## UC Berkeley

### Major Programs

| Program | Degree | Key Differences |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| EECS (College of Engineering) | BS | More math/science, harder to transfer into |
| CS (L&S → CDSS) | BA | More breadth courses, 3.0 GPA prereq to declare |
| Data Science (CDSS) | BA | Bridges CS and Stats, newer program |

### Official EECS Grading Guidelines

**Lower Division (e.g., 61A, 61B, 61C, 70):**
- Target GPA range: **2.8 - 3.3**
- Example for 3.0 GPA: 35% A's, 45% B's, 13% C's, 7% D/F

**Upper Division (e.g., 170, 189, 162):**
- Target GPA range: **3.0 - 3.5**
- Example for 3.2 GPA: 45% A's, 40% B's, 10% C's, 5% D/F

**Key Policy:** CS 61A and 61B are NOT curved (points-based). CS 70 IS curved.

## UC Berkeley - Lower Division CS Courses

### CS 61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Difficulty Tier** | Medium-High |
| **Avg Grade** | B+ |
| **Curved** | No (points-based) |
| **Workload** | 12-15 hrs/week |
| **Key Challenge** | Abstraction, recursion, functional programming |
| **Prerequisites** | None (intro course) |

**Student Perspective:** "Roadblock course" - required to declare CS. Learning curve is steep for those without prior programming experience.

### CS 61B: Data Structures
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Difficulty Tier** | High |
| **Avg Grade** | B+ |
| **Curved** | No (points-based) |
| **Workload** | 15-20 hrs/week |
| **Key Challenge** | High workload, complex projects |
| **Prerequisites** | CS 61A |

**Student Perspective:** "Hard because of high workload, not concepts." Projects are time-intensive.

### CS 61C: Machine Structures
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Difficulty Tier** | Medium |
| **Avg Grade** | B+ |
| **Curved** | Varies by semester |
| **Workload** | 12-15 hrs/week |
| **Key Challenge** | Low-level programming, memory management |
| **Prerequisites** | CS 61A, CS 61B |

**Student Perspective:** Often considered the "easiest of the 61 series" - expands into hardware/systems.

### CS 70: Discrete Math and Probability
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Difficulty Tier** | Very High |
| **Avg Grade** | B |
| **Curved** | Yes |
| **Workload** | 15-20+ hrs/week |
| **Key Challenge** | Proofs, mathematical maturity, conceptual difficulty |
| **Prerequisites** | Math 1A/1B (calculus) |

**Student Perspective:** "By far the hardest lower-div CS course." "One of the hardest classes CS majors will ever take." Two disconnected halves: discrete math (proofs) and probability.

### EECS 16A/16B: Designing Information Devices and Systems
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Difficulty Tier** | High (16B especially) |
| **Avg Grade** | B/B+ |
| **Curved** | No (16B: "If everyone scores 93%+, everyone gets an A") |
| **Workload** | 15+ hrs/week |
| **Key Challenge** | EE content, circuits, controls, SVD |
| **Prerequisites** | Math 54 (starting Fall 2025) |

**Student Perspective:** 16B is highly controversial. Student petition to remove it exists. "Poorly organized" according to many.

## Signals for Course Difficulty Assessment

### Positive Signals (Candidate did well in hard course)
1. A/A+ in Tier 4-5 courses
2. High grades in "weeder" courses (CS 70, Math 54, CS 374)
3. Strong performance in proof-based courses (indicates mathematical maturity)
4. Projects/internships alongside heavy course load

### Red Flags (Potential concerns)
1. Multiple retakes of core courses
2. Avoiding known difficult courses (taking "easier" electives)
3. Poor grades in foundational courses (61A/61B/225)
4. Significant grade drop in proof-based courses

### Context Needed
1. Which professor taught the course (difficulty varies)
2. What semester (pandemic grading was inflated)
3. Course load that semester
4. Whether student worked while studying
