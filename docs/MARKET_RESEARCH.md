# ZhiPin AI - Market Research & Go-to-Market Strategy

## Executive Summary

China's recruitment market presents a massive opportunity: a 30 million talent gap in key industries, 71.5% of companies already using AI in recruitment (up 3x from 2023), and existing platforms like Boss Zhipin facing user experience complaints. By adapting Mercor's AI-first model for the Chinese market, we can capture the underserved SME segment and tech companies struggling to find qualified candidates.

**3. Platform Frustrations (Boss Zhipin)**
- Inaccurate searches, expired listings
- Employers complain about ineffective paid services
- Fraud issues (fake listings)
- High marketing costs eating into profitability

**4. High Costs**

## Part 3: AI Recruitment Adoption in China

### Current State
- **91.58%** of Shanghai companies use AI in recruitment (2023 survey)
- **71.5%** of companies nationwide used AI in recruitment in 2024 (up 3x from prior year)
- **60%** of APAC companies using AI for recruitment

### How Chinese Companies Use AI
1. **Campus recruitment** for fresh graduates (high volume)
2. **Mass hiring** for seasonal workers
3. **Initial screening** - AI avatars conduct video interviews
4. **Resume parsing** and job matching

### Key Players
- **MoSeeker**: Hundreds of thousands of automated interviews/year (Disney, Mars clients)
- **CIIC Guangmou**: Virtual recruiter generating custom interview plans
- **Boss Zhipin**: 26% R&D spend, AI-powered matching

### The Gap: No "Mercor for China"
Current Chinese platforms focus on:
- Job board matching (Boss Zhipin)
- Headhunting for senior roles (Liepin)
- Basic resume screening

**What's missing:**
- Deep AI video interview analysis (like Mercor)
- Multi-dimensional candidate scoring
- Transparent evaluation reports for employers
- SME-affordable AI recruiting
